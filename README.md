# Inference in Opaque Systems

How do we make valid inferences about processes that are deliberately or structurally concealed?  

I have approached this problem via applications to militant organizational dynamics, subtext and negotiations in international organizations, hidden scientific communities, and diversifying supply chains for critical materials. 


The PRISM (Partial-Observation Inference & Structured Measurement) approach emerges from my research on conducting inference in domains where the ground truth is fundamentally unknowable or unattainable. This site documents and builds the methodological approach that I developed across multiple projects and extends and formalizes it for future users.

I build on existing and insightful work at the intersection of computational social science and machine learning, including <!-- text-as-data; Molly Roberts on censorship; Grimmer/Stewart/King inference with incomplete data/Chris Bail?/ -->

This is a working research program; feedback welcome as I develop these ideas toward a methods paper and potential software implementation.

— is a methodological framework for reasoning under partial observability and strategic opacity.  
It provides a structured workflow for designing, measuring, and inferring when key mechanisms are hidden by design or data are adversarially generated.

### Quick Overview
PRISM helps researchers:
- Diagnose inference problems in opaque or adversarial data environments  
- Map hidden systems and identify observable traces  
- Translate traces into measurable features  
- Estimate and evaluate under uncertainty
