How do we make valid inferences about processes that are deliberately or structurally concealed?  

This question motivates my work. I have approached this problem via applications to militant organizational dynamics, subtext and negotiations in international organizations, hidden scientific communities, and diversifying supply chains for critical materials. 

To address this problem **PRISM** — *Partial-Observation Inference & Structured Measurement* — is a methodological framework for reasoning under partial observability and strategic opacity.  
It provides a structured workflow for designing, measuring, and inferring when key mechanisms are hidden by design or data are adversarially generated.

### Quick Overview
PRISM helps researchers:
- Diagnose inference problems in opaque or adversarial data environments  
- Map hidden systems and identify observable traces  
- Translate traces into measurable features  
- Estimate and evaluate under uncertainty
