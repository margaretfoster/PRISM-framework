## PRISM Step 3: Estimation and Indirect Identification ##

Run the statistical or machine learning estimation method using features derived from traces. 
Possible estimation approaches: 

- Statistical associations with other, more accessible data
- Machine learning: how does the process you are interested in generate patterns (or perturb patterns that wouldn't exist without that process)
- Qualitative analysis
  
Denote which parts of the designs are inferred via correlated or derivative process and which, if any, are direct. 

Triangulate to structure the design of additional inference.  Can qualitative or other trace data reinforce weaknesses in the inference?
