## PRISM Step 3: Estimation and Indirect Identification ##

**NOV 2025: In-Progress Draft**

## Direct Approaches:

When features derived from traces map relatively cleanly to the process of interest, standard estimation approaches apply. Run statistical or machine learning methods using the measured features alongside more accessible process or outcome data.

Established tools include:

- Econometric analysis with proxy variables
- Network methodologies for inference in incompletely observed contexts (Everton, Cunningham, Moody)
- Supervised learning when ground truth is partially available
      
# Indirect Inference:

When data context remains opaque after measurement-- such as when the measurement approaches cover only one facet of the process, ground truth is unknown, or the data otherwise do not allow for clean identification of the theorized process-- inference becomes more challenging. 

In these cases, the PRISM Framework draws on the strategies of mixed-methods research and proposes indirect inference through structured triangulation across multiple independent sources. 

The core suggestion is to separate estimation and inference, estimate what one can, and then use patterns in the estimate(s) to draw inferential conclusions.

## Core Logic:

When different trace sources capture different dimensions of hidden mechanisms, one can reinforce conclusions through complementary types of evidence. 

For example:
- Event data reveal behaviors, evolution, and response patterns
- Text can suggest framing and attention
- Network traces expose relational structure and coordination
- 
Although potentially underwhelming individually, statistical or machine learning modeling of each strand of evidence can build a nuanced picture of the difficult-to-access system.

## Interpreting Convergence and Divergence:
The relationship between independent sources provides information to evaluate systems that are initially resistant to measurement 

***Convergence across sources*** increases confidence in both the underlying finding and the proposed mechanism. 
When multiple, ideally independent outcome dimensions align temporally and substantively, this supports the desired inference.

***Divergence between sources*** tends not to support a single inferential story.
Reasons for divergence might include:

- Strategic deception or deliberate misdirection that remains through measurement and triangulation
- Measurement artifacts or gaps in one or more traces
- Multiple mechanisms operating simultaneously
- Empirically unsupported theoretical measurement

## Estimation Pathways for Opaque Contexts

Specific strategies for indirect identification include:

- Statistical Association:

Correlate bespoke measures with more accessible outcome or process data
Test whether measured traces associate with theoretically predicted consequences
Use timing and pattern to support mechanistic claims even without causal identification

- Pattern Detection:

Machine learning approaches that identify how hidden processes generate or perturb patterns
Classification models that distinguish organizational states
Clustering or dimensionality reduction to reveal latent structure

- Qualitative Integration:

Case-level validation of quantitative patterns
Process tracing to confirm or challenge statistical findings
Expert knowledge to interpret ambiguous results

## Inferential Chain Visibility :

Transparency helps readers evaluate the strength of claims and identify where additional evidence would strengthen the inference. Thus, it is important to identify when estimates are derived from:

- Direct observation of proximate outcomes or traces
- Indirect inference via correlated or derivative processes
- When the mechanism is inferred rather than measured
