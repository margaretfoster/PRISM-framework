## PRISM Step 3: Estimation and Indirect Identification ##

**NOV 2025- Draft that needs citations**

## Direct Approaches:

When features derived from traces map relatively cleanly to the process of interest, standard estimation approaches apply. Run statistical or machine learning methods using the measured features alongside more accessible process or outcome data.

Established tools include:

- Econometric analysis with proxy variables
- Network methodologies for inference in incompletely observed contexts (Everton, Cunningham, Moody)
- Supervised learning when ground truth is partially available
      
# Indirect Inference:

When data context remains opaque after measurement-- such as when the measurement approaches cover only one facet of the process, ground truth is unknown, or the data otherwise do not allow for clean estimation of the theorized process-- inference becomes more challenging. 

Here PRISM leans on strategies from mixed methods research and proposes indirect inference through structured triangulation across multiple independent sources. 

Pathways include:

- Statistical associations between bespoke measures and more accessible outcome or process data 
- Machine learning: how does the process generate patterns (or perturb patterns that wouldn't exist without that process)
- Qualitative analysis
