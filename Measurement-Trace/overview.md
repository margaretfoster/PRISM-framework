## PRISM Step 2: Trace and Measurement ##

__Trace Capture__ 

Use the set of accessible candidate traces to inform the desired theory/mechanism/construct.
Use tools developed by research traditions that identify and process traces.

Map them to potentially reachable sources, such as:

Archives:
- Primary texts
- Minutes and transcripts
- Legal documents
- Government records
  
Monitoring data:

- event data 
- satellite or signal data (when accessible)


__Bootstrapping Traces to Features__

Turn the traces into features, labels, or composite indicators that estimation methods can consume.

Use theory and case knowledge to evaluate, falsify, and validate the extraction of features from available traces. Example: embeddings, event aggregation, rule-based classification.

Connect to and build from computational social science, data science, and machine learning/AI that increase the availability of traces:

- embeddings
- text-as-data or image-as-data
- clusterings
- event aggregation
- rule-based classification

__Measurement Validation__ 

Use domain knowledge or theory to identify heuristics for assessing whether the trace-to-measurement conversion was accurate and robust.
What do the measures need to accurately find? 
What results would invalidate the accuracy or utility of the measure?
Is there complementary work that can be used for validation benchmarks?
