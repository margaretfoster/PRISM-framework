PRISM Framework Step 1: Diagnose the problem.
  
What is the target process or mechanism? 
What are the observability challenges? 
Is the absence due to structural holes, strategic concealment, or access limitations?
Is the concept fundamentally resistant to measurement, such as a latent or abstract variable?
Then identify which elements of the system are observable and which are never accessible, given the constraints. 
Questions to address:
- Is the lack of data a structural feature or measurement error?
- Is reframing possible? (Eg, perspectives on insurgent-constituency relationships studied from within a rebel group versus from among a local constituency.)
- Can the design be reframed to study outputs or consequences rather than the hidden process itself?
- Is there a route to variation in observability, such as a natural experiment or policy change?
- What would I need to see to convince a skeptical causal inference reviewer?
