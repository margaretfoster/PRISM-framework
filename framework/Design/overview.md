## PRISM Framework Step 1: Diagnose ## 

__Diagnosis__

What is the target process or mechanism? What are the observability challenges? Is the absence due to structural holes, strategic concealment, or access limitations? Is the concept fundamentally resistant to measurement, such as a latent or abstract variable? Then identify which elements of the system are observable and which are never accessible, given the constraints. Questions to address:

Is the lack of data a structural feature or measurement error?
Is reframing possible? (Eg, perspectives on insurgent-constituency relationships studied from within a rebel group versus from among a local constituency.)
Can the design be reframed to study outputs or consequences rather than the hidden process itself?
Is there a route to variation in observability, such as a natural experiment or policy change?
What would I need to see to convince a skeptical causal inference reviewer?

__Map the Hidden System__

Use domain knowledge and theoretical expectations to formalize expectations about the unobservable process. Enumerate the actions and states that accompany the unobservable process or mechanism. Map those processes and states to touchpoints in the observable world.

Identify which touchpoints leave accessible traces and are most informative for the desired mechanism?

__Structure Using Theory__

What does the theory predict about how touchpoints translate into observable traces?

What patterns would confirm or refute the theorized mechanism versus other alternative explanations?

Connect to and draw from:

- process tracing patterns to build observable implications of hidden mechanisms
- structured analytic techniques
- causal graphs and DAG logic (e.g. Pearl 2009)
