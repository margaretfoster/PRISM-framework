Bootstrapping Traces to Features

Turn the traces into features, labels, or composite indicators that estimation methods can consume. 

Use theory and case knowledge to evaluate, falsify, and validate the extraction of features from available traces. 
Example: embeddings, event aggregation, rule-based classification.

Connect to and build from computational social science, data science, and machine learning/AI that increase the availability of traces:

- embeddings
- text-as-data or image-as-data
- clusterings
- event aggregation
- rule-based classification
