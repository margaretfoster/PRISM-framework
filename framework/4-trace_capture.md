PRISM Step 4: Trace Capture
Use the set of accessible candidate traces to inform the desired theory/mechanism/construct.
Map them to potentially reachable sources, such as primary texts, trade flows, secondary reporting, or monitoring data (satellite, legal documents, government records).

Connect to and build from research traditions that identify and process traces, such as:

- monitoring data: trade, satellite, newspaper reporting
- archival data: texts, legal documents, meeting minutes or transcripts
