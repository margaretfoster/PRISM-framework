PRISM Step 4: Trace Capture
Use the set of accessible candidate traces to inform the desired theory/mechanism/construct.
Map them to potentially reachable sources, such as primary texts, trade flows, secondary reporting, or monitoring data (satellite, legal documents, government records).

Connect to and build from computational social science methods that increase the availability of traces:

- embeddings
- text-as-data or image-as-data
- clusterings
