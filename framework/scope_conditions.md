## Scope Conditions

What PRISM does and does not contribute:

- PRISM  enables systematic inference about partially observable processes and adversarially-generated data;  generation of falsifiable claims about hidden mechanisms, and rigorous triangulation across imperfect or incomplete data sources

- The framework can not provide point identification of effects (such as in RCTs), eliminate all alternative explanations, or generate data that doesn't exist.


The PRISM approach can (and should) be supplanted by other methods when:

- Qualitative case studies and process tracing are more appropriate. For example, hypothesized processes based on a few major actors and contexts where the scholar can conduct direct research on the processes of interest.
- Simulations are a better tool: when the inputs and outputs can be mapped, and simulation tools can text expectations about the internal dynamics.
- When data are widely available and missingness is due to randomness, not design or strategic concealment. 
- When the target question can not be answered with the available traces.
